# CS532FinalProject

### Cancer Classification
This dataset is obtained from the <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq'>UCI Machine Learning repository website</a>. This collection of data is part of the RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set, it is a random extraction of gene expressions of patients having different types of tumor: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD. There are 801 instances with 20531 attributes. 

The goal of this project is to apply logistic regression, support vector machine, and neural networks classification algorithms that are covered
in ECE/CS532 course on the dataset and analyze the results.
